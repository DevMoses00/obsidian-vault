## How To Start Your Day Softly (Even If You're Note A Morning Person Anymore)

Zero hour: Before the responsibilities of the day begin, before work, messages, chores, or even breakfast, I give myself one hour to do whatever I want. I can watch a show, scribble in a notebook, sit and stare out the window, or listening to my favorite music. 

Choosing joy over productivity. Our nervous systems need much more lightness and freedom than we realize - they need softness.

## When it comes to Burnout and Healing Our Nervous System

My body is already overwhelmed. Starting the day off with pressure, even if it's deemed as "self-care", can be too much. Soft morning can help interrupt the cycle of instant elevated cortisol levels - thinking today will be meant for survival.

When I don't write things down and carry a mental load of tasks I need to complete, I'm setting myself up for exhaustion. A zero hour gives time to not be responsible for a minute.

## If Doing "Nothing" Feels Wrong: 

It's common to feel guilty about these things - but guilt is not proof that you're doing something wrong. It's an echo of an old belief, that you have to earn your rest. That you need to be productive to be worthy.

And remember, some mornings, life happens and you won't be able to complete your zero hour. Your whole day's not going to be ruined. It's what you return to most days that matter, not what you do perfectly everyday.

Start your mornings slow. Start your mornings for you. Let them be soft. Let them be slow. Let them be a place where you return to yourself before you return to the world.
