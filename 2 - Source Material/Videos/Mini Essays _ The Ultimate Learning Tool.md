# What Are Mini Essays?

Mini essays are short pieces of writing surrounding a specific topic. They're a tool for writing to better understand a particular topic of interest, or moment of resonance. Ideas that stood out to you are worth writing mini essays for. These are an investment, they take time and effort, but it's so worth it.

You'll find noticeable improvements in your writing, reading, and your understanding of a topic, and I will become a better learner from it. Reading and writing mean a lot to me.

Write a mini essay like you are going to teach someone about the topic.

# Deep Learning. Perfect Retention

The ability to remember and understand what I read. I can go use this and recall this in my daily life.

# Main Benefits of Mini Essays

1. Volume - many novice writers have a burst of confidence, but they don't always write actually. Every writer has to have stuff to show off. Mini essays offer a solution to this because you can **put in the reps**. 
	1. You don't become a good writer by just thinking about writing every once and a while. You have to do it actively and consistently. That's the only way you can become a better writer, a better thinker. Sustained effort will reward you - that's the fact.
	2. A common hurdle is not knowing what to write about. But mini essays help you free from that because it's focused on such a specific topic
2. Novelty - mini essays allow you to harvest the power of new and unexpected and unfamiliar - that energy encourages you to write. Only 20-25 minutes of writing to learn and understand something new - fun, accessible, and helpful for my own understanding.
3. Idea Bank - Mini essays allow you to build a bank of ideas. I can draw from my building network for whatever I want to write about. Helps me remember and reference without the struggle. 

# How to Write a Mini Essay

**What Makes a Mini Essay?**
- They're short - 100 - 300 words long, try to fit wherever on the page. Prevents you from rambling and helps you be brief.
- Keep the format to how you would like them to be read?
	- Some mini essays can be more informative, like I'm teaching them to a class
	- Others can be creative and storytelling formats, for more intimate settings or purely creative exercises.
		- Prose and Poetry works to! Carve your own path in learning.
- Constrict them to a single concept or idea - the moment you try and incorporate more, you lose the mini essay's identity.

Stay consistent! This helps you build as a writer, it's time to put in those reps.
