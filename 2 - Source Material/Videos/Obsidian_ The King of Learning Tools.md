## **Turning tags into indexes**

An index is almost like the contents of a book, take all of the notes within a tag, and apply some sort of logical structure to it.

All you have to do is open up the tag, and start filling out the tag space with the notes that tag is applied to, and categorize them based on a particular structure.

Add a basic level of structure to the notes to easily start on a topic that you want to jump into.

## **Ideas to use notes**

Mark spots in your book, game, movie, etc. as points of interest. Then go back through the material once completed and conduct a formal write up.

Include page numbers and quotes, summaries or tangents, explanations or reactions - whatever this thing reminds you of or what it makes you want tor read next

Take the time to flesh out your notes! This is meant to solidify your learning in a much more impactful way than copying and pasting down quotes. It forces us to reflect and think and truly understand what is going on.

Once you write notes in the source material, create another note for the bigger picture full notes - what does it all mean? The full notes are not in context to the source material, they can expand past it in a much more connected way

*use quote status updates to easily reference them* 

*use baby, child, adult statuses on your notes to better gauge at what stage your notes are in*

# Pointers for effective tagging

1. Avoid being too vague
	- Ex: Self-improvement as a tag feels so vague, what does it mean and what is it in regards to?
2. Avoid being too specific 
	- You're gonna want to use the tag again, so ask yourself "Will I ever use this tag again?"
3. Personalize your tags
	- Make your tags based on your interest, not what other people consider to be good tags
	- This system is your second-brain - personalize how you want!
4. Avoid using too many tags
	- Below 4-5 tags so it's not too overwhelming

# How to Keep Notes Focused and Free From Clutter

1. Keep notes short(ish) - use these notes as tools and sources for those larger writing projects
2. <500 words - have all the words fit within the page so that it looks focused
3. Tackle one idea at a time - clear and as flexible as possible
	1. Too complicated of a note might just make the note harder to understand
	2. THESE ARE NOTES - keep them small and connected instead of large and complicate
4. Format notes so that they're easier to read - natural breakpoints = less mental energy
5. **Hyperlink to related notes and source material notes**
	1. Maybe even go to the tags of the note to find similar or related notes
