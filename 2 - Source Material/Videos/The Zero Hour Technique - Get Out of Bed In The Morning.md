##  The Zero Hour Technique - Get Out of Bed In The Morning

## How to start a morning routine!

Do you really have a morning routine?
- Ex: Light, wash face, hydrate, light exercise
-  But what happens when that doesn't happen, and you struggle to move on to the next phase of the day

**Zero Hour: A class period before school actually started to do a particular activity
- An indulgent activity to do in the morning
	- Play a video game for an hour! It's easy to play late at night and not feel motivated to wake up the next day. But if I tell myself that I get to play a game first thing in the morning, I could have a lot more motivation!
	- Reading fiction or nonfiction - a great option to study and enjoy in the morning
	- Make art first thing in the morning, especially when it's not related to work!
	- Deep listening to music - really get into an album right in the morning!
	- Work on a notebook project - journaling or music compiling
	- Playlist making - especially curating vibes is something I enjoy doing
	
- Note: Let these be light and indulgent - they should feel like something you look forward to doing, not something you feel like you have to do to be productive. If I'm really wanting to play a video game, do that instead of feeling pressured to read and feel more productive that way.

A hobby hour + relax time first thing in the morning. Helps you not squander that time by just doomscrolling on the internet. Motivating and fun to do as a way to set up the morning positively.
