## Writing Mini Essays to Combat The Anti-learning Age

I feel somewhat lucky to be the age I am right now. I completed all of my foundation education the "hard way" - writing essays on paper, using long equations and formulas to solve math problems, read textbooks chapter to chapter without any aid to summarize them for me. I did these all in school because I had to if I wanted to learn and do well in my classes. There wasn't an online alternative, at least not one so widely accessible that I'd see it everywhere I looked. From ads on youtube to well-established multi-million-dollar companies incorporating tools faster than the public can comprehend. I feel lucky people learning felt difficult to do, and it's worrying that learning doesn't feel as much of a priority right now. While education as a whole is dealing with the rise of ai, one of the issues on the long list of ai side-effects relates to the modern adult and our pursuit of a meaningful life.

With such a busy and complicated schedule, growing responsibilities, and the common life crises we undergo as we age, there is so much pressure built up within us that it feels almost impossible to overcome. We seek release valves everywhere we go, and the world around us can't wait to provide us with the solutions to our inconvenient, difficult lives. We can find everything we could ever want to know through our phones, which had it's own set of concerns with the rise of the internet and mobile devices more powerful than we ever give them credit for, but now the world is promising that everything we could ever want to learn to do - the things we would need to gain skills in - can be done through emerging technologies in record time and little thought.

That reality terrifies me. As someone who values learning and developing my skills, I enjoy the idea of earning the ability of developing something people interact with - through my own developed knowledge base, and the reps of trying and failing to understand and trying again. We're losing our drive for hard thinking, and the moment we lose that completely, companies can take advantage of us in any way they see fit. We'll be fully driven by the thoughts of the most powerful, the most that can gain from an unconscious, unlearned population. 

My attempt to combat this will include more conscious learning, better note-taking, and mini essays that reinforce my learning. Mini essays are simple and flexible ways to prove you understand what you've learned. It is a reflective tool that asks you to recall and explain the topic you had learned, as a way to solidify your learning and then have the ability to teach it others. Mini essays not only shine a light on the gaps in my knowledge base, but they also serve as consistent, high-volume practice for someone that is a writer. My mini essays will focus sharply on a single topic, will be ~300 words long to prevent rambling, and can take the form of prose, poetry, or expository essays. Overall these mini essays will help me to better recall everything I want to learn, while actively combating the reliance on tools to do my learning for me. Learning and doing will be slower, but I believe this is the path toward a more nourished life that doesn't revolve around frictionless technology and exploitation.
