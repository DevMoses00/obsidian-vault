##  Disco Elysium - ZA_UM

#### Personal notes on Disco Elysium Before Starting:

I had played a good chunk of this game closer to when it came out, somewhere around 2021-22. I was enthralled by the fully voiced experience, and while the dialogue was unmatched, I remember struggling to comprehend large portions of the games political takes. I hope that through playing this game with much more intention and note taking, I can learn a lot from this game and grow in thinking, understanding, and hopefully satisfaction with this experience.

**2025 - 11 - 18 Notes**

Archetype selected: SENSITIVE - psychological magnetic personality, though unstable
- We wake up with amnesia and plenty of voices in our head. We surmise from the lady out front that we are police or RCM, here for three days, and I haven't been doing anything regarding the case. 

Character Study - Kim Kitsuragi
- Protagonist's assistant - a level-headed, reserved character that often times acts as the primary source of reason and morality. At the beginning of meeting him, Kim provides a lot of the context of the situation. He informs the player of what is going on, and fills in a lot of knowledge gaps.

Location - Martinaise, Revachol - year - 51'
- A post revolution world
-  The Dockworkers Union is the de facto police in Martinaise
- Lena, The crytpozoologist's wife: "Revachol is a Zone of Control, led by an alliance of foreign powers called the Coalition. We have almost no government of our own. And *certainly* no dictatorship of the proletariat"

Learning About Myself: 
According to Kim, the protagonist lives in Jamrock, which is supposedly not that far away from Martinaise.
18 years as an officer, with over 200 cases closed, three confirmed kills
But recently, he's a lost man according to his fellow officers - a drunk that has lost his way.
###  The Thought Cabinet
- This is something I would like to explore more of. What is it, and how does it contribute to the overall gameplay? I can spend time internalizing thoughts in the background while I go about my day. And I get temporary bonuses to my stats?

Talking on the radio to my colleagues at the 41st precinct
Narrative omniscience - There are moments where the narrator listens in on the conversations of other characters entirely - accompanied by some dramatic music - feels like i'm reading a book and peering into another world outside of the protagonist when that happens.


# Reader’s Guide! (for self study, inbetween meets)

## I. Characters and their feelings… 

The game starts with a blank slate. How does the protagonist's identity come through interactions and dialogue (internal and external)? 

1. The Skill System as Personality: Which Disco Elysium skill did you prioritize in the beginning, and why? Do you find that skill influencing your decisions in ways that feel natural to you, or ways that feel like a character you are playing?
    
2. The Dialogue as Character Voice: The protagonist has many internal voices speaking to him. Which of these voices do you most consistently trust? Which voice do you find is the most disruptive?
    
3. The Thought Cabinet: When you internalize a thought, you commit to an ideology or a perspective. What thought have you found most compelling so far? Does the process of internalizing an idea feel like a genuine moment of enlightenment or self-sabotage?
    
4. The Moral Flaw (Optional): All great literary characters have a central flaw. Based on your early actions, what do you think is your protagonist's most compelling moral or psychological flaw?
    

## II. Setting & Environment (Revachol?) 

How does the setting itself tells a story? Pay attention to the discarded objects, the architecture, and the signs. What is the most powerful piece of passive environmental storytelling you’ve discovered so far? What does it communicate about the city’s past or current state?

5. Weather and Mood: How does the game use weather, time of day, and lighting to manipulate your emotional state? Does the setting enhance or contradict the themes being discussed in the dialogue? 
    
6. History: The city is marked by history (war, revolution, collapse). How does the game show you the layers of history without explicitly giving you a history lesson?
    

## III. Narrative Structure & Game Mechanics 

8. Unreliable Narrator(s!): Since your protagonist has amnesia, he is an inherently unreliable narrator. How does this mechanic change your approach to the investigation compared to other mystery games? Does it force you to analyze the source of the information (the skills) rather than just the facts?
    
9. The Meaning of Failure: Disco Elysium often makes failure compelling, or even necessary. Describe an instance where a skill check failure was more narratively satisfying than a success would have been. What does this suggest about the role of failure in art? [Try not to save scum!]
    
10. The Game as Political Text: The game introduces a ton of complex political and philosophical concepts. How does the game (like how people react to your political views) force you to engage with these concepts actively, rather than just reading about them?
    

## IV. Art, Sound, & Aesthetics (vibes?) 

11. The Sound of Existential Dread: Focus on the music and ambient noise. How does the sound design contribute to the feeling of dread, loneliness, or humor? Is the score used to reflect the protagonist's internal state or the external world's atmosphere?
    
12. Visual Vocabulary: Describe the game's unique art style. How does the art direction—its use of color, texture, and caricature—make the characters and the world feel more real, or more surreal, than a photorealistic style would?
    
13. Costume as Character: Analyze the characters' clothing. How do their garments and possessions serve as a visual form of dialogue or foreshadowing regarding their role in the story? (To game mechanics, how do the costume items and the points they provide or take away contribute to storytelling?) 
    

## V. Developer's Voice & Intent (Critique and Meaning)

14. The Author's Voice: What is the strongest piece of evidence you've seen so far that reveals the developer's own philosophy or sense of humor? Is the game attempting to persuade you toward a certain worldview, or merely present options?
    
15. Beyond the Stigma: Based on your experience so far, what is the single best argument you could use to convince a skeptic (like Roger Ebert) that Disco Elysium deserves to be treated as a major work of contemporary art and literature?
